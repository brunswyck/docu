run commands in script as sudo
------------------------------


.. note:: Always use the command visudo to edit the sudoers file to make sure you do not lock yourself out of the system â€“ just in case you accidentally write something incorrect to the sudoers file. visudo will save your modified file to a temporary location and will only overwrite the real sudoers file if the modified file can be parsed without errors.

**Using /etc/sudoers.d instead of modifying /etc/sudoers**


example for DHCP
::
# User alias specification
User_Alias DHCPUSERS = guru, patrick


If sudoers is messed up
