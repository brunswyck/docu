Etherchannel - Hot Standby Routing Protocol
===========================================

Restrictions
------------

.. image:: ../../../_static/img/4_la_hsrp_restrictions.png

.. note:: Interface types cannot be mixed; for example, Fast Ethernet and Gigabit Ethernet cannot be mixed within a single EtherChannel

.. note:: The EtherChannel provides full-duplex bandwidth up to 800 Mb/s (Fast EtherChannel) or 8 Gb/s (Gigabit EtherChannel) between one switch and another switch or host. Currently each EtherChannel can consist of up to eight compatibly-configured Ethernet ports atm.

.. note:: IOS switch can currently support six EtherChannels (so 6 x 8 ports max)

- The individual EtherChannel group member port configuration must be consistent on both devices. If the physical ports of one side are configured as trunks, the physical ports of the other side must also be configured as trunks within the same native VLAN. Additionally, all ports in each EtherChannel link must be configured as Layer 2 ports.

- Each EtherChannel has a logical port channel interface, illustrated in the figure. A configuration applied to the port channel interface affects all physical interfaces that are assigned to that interface.

.. note:: Layer 3 EtherChannels can be configured on Cisco Catalyst multilayer switches, such as the Catalyst 3560

Port Aggregation Protocol PAgP
------------------------------


PAgP modes:

 - On: Channel member without negotiation (no protocol).
 - Desirable: Actively asking if the other side can or will participate.
 - Auto: Passively waiting for the other side.
   
The EtherChannel is then added to the spanning tree as a single port.

When enabled, PAgP also manages the EtherChannel. PAgP packets are sent every 30 seconds. PAgP checks for configuration consistency and manages link additions and failures between two switches. It ensures that when an EtherChannel is created, all ports have the same type of configuration.

.. note:: In EtherChannel, it is mandatory that all ports have the same speed, duplex setting, and VLAN information. Any port modification after the creation of the channel also changes all other channel ports.

LACP (802.3ad now 802.1AX)
--------------------------

LACP modes:

 - On: Channel member without negotiation (no protocol).
 - Active: Actively asking if the other side can or will participate.
 - Passive: Passively waiting for the other side.

 +-------------------+----------------+-----------------------+
 | Passive/On        | Passive        | No                    |
 +-------------------+----------------+-----------------------+

.. note:: LACP allows for eight active links, and also eight standby links. A standby link will become active should one of the current active links fail.

Configuration Guidelines
------------------------

The following guidelines and restrictions are useful for configuring EtherChannel:

 - EtherChannel support 
   All Ethernet interfaces on all modules must support EtherChannel with no requirement that interfaces be physically contiguous, or on the same module.
 - Speed and duplex 
   Configure all interfaces in an EtherChannel to operate at the same speed and in the same duplex mode.
 - VLAN match 
   All interfaces in the EtherChannel bundle must be assigned to the same VLAN, or be configured as a trunk (also shown in the figure).
 - Range of VLANs 
   An EtherChannel supports the same allowed range of VLANs on all the interfaces in a trunking EtherChannel. If the allowed range of VLANs is not the same, the interfaces do not form an EtherChannel, even when set to auto or desirable mode.
 
.. note:: Any configuration that is applied to the port channel interface also affects individual interfaces. However, configurations that are applied to the individual interfaces do not affect the port channel interface. Therefore, making configuration changes to an interface that is part of an EtherChannel link may cause interface compatibility issues.

.. note:: The port channel can be configured in access mode, trunk mode (most common), or on a routed port.

Configuring Etherchannel LACP
-----------------------------


#. Specify the interfaces, good practice is to shut em down

   .. code::
      
      S1(config)# interface range FastEthernet0/1 - 2
      S1(config-if-range)# channel-group 1 mode active
      S1(config-if-range)# interface port-channel 1
      S1(config-if-range)# no shutdown
      S1(config-if)# switchport mode trunk
      S1(config-if)# switchport trunk allowed vlan 1,2,20

#. Create the port channel interface with the channel-group identifier mode active command in interface range

   .. code::

      S2(config)# interface range f0/23 - 24
      S2(config-if-range)# channel-group 3 mode ?
       active     Enable LACP unconditionally
       auto       Enable PAgP only if a PAgP
       device is detected
       desirable  Enable PAgP unconditionally
       on         Enable Etherchannel only
       passive    Enable LACP only if a LACP device is detected
      S2(config-if-range)# channel-group 3 mode active


#. Enter port channel interface configuration mode to configure the ports

   .. code::

      S2(config-if-range)# interface port-channel 1
      S2(config-if)# switchport mode trunk
      S2(config-if)# switchport trunk native vlan 99

      S3(config)# interface port-channel 1
      S3(config-if)# switchport mode trunk
      S3(config-if)# switchport trunk native vlan 99

#. Verify configuration
   
   .. code::
   
      S1# show run interface f0/3
      S1# show interfaces f0/3 switchport
      
      Verify that the ports have been aggregated.

troubleshooting
---------------


Assign all ports in the EtherChannel to the same VLAN, or configure them as trunks. Ports with different native VLANs cannot form an EtherChannel.

    When configuring a trunk on an EtherChannel, verify the trunking mode on the EtherChannel. It is not recommended that you configure trunking mode on individual ports that make up the EtherChannel. But if it is done, verify that the trunking configuration is the same on all interfaces.

    An EtherChannel supports the same allowed range of VLANs on all the ports. If the allowed range of VLANs is not the same, the ports do not form an EtherChannel even when PAgP is set to the auto or desirable mode.

    The dynamic negotiation options for PAgP and LACP must be compatibly configured on both ends of the EtherChannel.

Note: It is easy to confuse PAgP or LACP with DTP, because they both are protocols used to automate behavior on trunk links. PAgP and LACP are used for link aggregation (EtherChannel). DTP is used for automating the creation of trunk links. When an EtherChannel trunk is configured, typically EtherChannel (PAgP or LACP) is configured first and then DTP.


interfaces F0/1 and F0/2 on switches S1 and S2 are connected with an EtherChannel. The output indicates that the EtherChannel is down.

.. code::

above, more detailed output indicates that there are incompatible PAgP modes configured on S1 and S2.

.. image:: ../../../_static/img/4_la_hsrp_troubleshooting_etherchannel2.png

As you can see, the PAgP mode on the EtherChannel is changed to desirable and the EtherChannel becomes active.

.. warning:: EtherChannel and spanning tree must interoperate. For this reason, the order in which EtherChannel-related commands are entered is important, which is why above you see interface Port-Channel 1 removed and then re-added with the channel-group command, as opposed to directly changed. If one tries to change the configuration directly, spanning tree errors cause the associated ports to go into blocking or errdisabled state.

First Hop Redundancy Protocols
------------------------------

.. image:: ../../../_static/img/4_la_hsrp_steps_router_failover.png

#. The standby router stops seeing Hello messages from the forwarding router
#. The standby router assumes the role of the forwarding router
#. Because the new forwarding router assumes both the IPv4 and MAC addresses of the virtual router, the host devices see no disruption in service

Default Gateway Limitations
---------------------------

.. note: For the purposes of the discussion on router redundancy, there is no functional difference between a multilayer switch and a router at the distribution layer. In practice, it is common for a multilayer switch to act as the default gateway for each VLAN in a switched network. This discussion focuses on the functionality of routing, regardless of the physical device used.

- Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP) 
   A Cisco-proprietary FHRP designed to allow for transparent failover of a first-hop IPv4 device. HSRP provides high network availability by providing first-hop routing redundancy for IPv4 hosts on networks configured with an IPv4 default gateway address. HSRP is used in a group of routers for selecting an active device and a standby device. In a group of device interfaces, the active device is the device that is used for routing packets; the standby device is the device that takes over when the active device fails, or when pre-set conditions are met. The function of the HSRP standby router is to monitor the operational status of the HSRP group and to quickly assume packet-forwarding responsibility if the active router fails.

- HSRP for IPv6
   Cisco-proprietary FHRP providing the same functionality of HSRP, but in an IPv6 environment.
   An HSRP IPv6 group has a virtual MAC address derived from the HSRP group number and a virtual IPv6 link-local address derived from the HSRP virtual MAC address. Periodic router advertisements (RAs) are sent for the HSRP virtual IPv6 link-local address when the HSRP group is active. When the group becomes inactive these RAs stop after a final RA is sent. 

- Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol version 2 (VRRPv2)
   A non-proprietary election protocol that dynamically assigns responsibility for one or more virtual routers to the VRRP routers on an IPv4 LAN. This allows several routers on a multiaccess link to use the same virtual IPv4 address. A VRRP router is configured to run the VRRP protocol in conjunction with one or more other routers attached to a LAN. In a VRRP configuration, one router is elected as the virtual router master, with the other routers acting as backups, in case the virtual router master fails.
 
- VRRPv3
   Provides the capability to support IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. VRRPv3 works in multi-vendor environments and is more scalable than VRRPv2

- Gateway Load Balancing Protocol (GLBP)
   Cisco-proprietary FHRP that protects data traffic from a failed router or circuit, like HSRP and VRRP, while also allowing load balancing (also called load sharing) between a group of redundant routers.

- GLBP for IPv6
   Cisco-proprietary FHRP providing the same functionality of GLBP, but in an IPv6 environment. GLBP for IPv6 provides automatic router backup for IPv6 hosts configured with a single default gateway on a LAN. Multiple first-hop routers on the LAN combine to offer a single virtual first-hop IPv6 router while sharing the IPv6 packet forwarding load.

- ICMP Router Discovery Protocol (IRDP)
   Specified in RFC 1256, is a legacy FHRP solution. IRDP allows IPv4 hosts to locate routers that provide IPv4 connectivity to other (nonlocal) IP networks.

VIRTUAL ROUTER
--------------

One way to prevent a single point of failure at the default gateway, is to implement a virtual router. To implement this type of router redundancy, multiple routers are configured to work together to present the illusion of a single router to the hosts on the LAN

HOT STANDBY Router Protocol (HSRP)
----------------------------------

Gateway Load Balancing Protocol (GLBP)

GLBP for IPv6 - Cisco-proprietary FHRP providing the same functionality of GLBP, but in an IPv6 environment.

HSRP Preemption
---------------

By default, after a router becomes the active router, it will remain the active router even if another router comes online with a higher HSRP priority.

To force a new HSRP election process, preemption must be enabled using the standby preempt interface command. Preemption is the ability of an HSRP router to trigger the re-election process. With preemption enabled, a router that comes online with a higher HSRP priority will assume the role of the active router.

Preemption only allows a router to become the active router if it has a higher priority. A router enabled for preemption, with equal priority but a higher IPv4 address will not preempt an active router. Refer to the topology in the figure.

After power is restored, R1 comes back online. Because R1 has a higher priority and preemption is enabled, it will force a new election process. R1 will re-assume the role of the active router and R2 will fall back to the role of the standby router.

Note: With preemption disabled, the router that boots up first will become the active router if there are no other routers online during the election process.

HSRP States
-----------
	
Initial
This state is entered through a configuration change or when an interface first becomes available.
		
Learn
The router has not determined the virtual IP address and has not yet seen a hello message from the active router. In this state, the router waits to hear from the active router.
		
Listen
The router knows the virtual IP address, but the router is neither the active router nor the standby router. It listens for hello messages from those routers.
		
Speak
The router sends periodic hello messages and actively participates in the election of the active and/or standby router.
		
Standby
The router is a candidate to become the next active router and sends periodic hello messages.
		
Active
The router currently forwards packets that are sent to the group virtual MAC address. The router sends periodic hello messages.

The active and standby HSRP routers send hello packets to the HSRP group multicast address every 3 seconds, by default. The standby router will become active if it does not receive a hello message from the active router after 10 seconds. You can lower these timer settings to speed up the failover or preemption. However, to avoid increased CPU usage and unnecessary standby state changes, do not set the hello timer below 1 second or the hold timer below 4 seconds.

Troubleshooting HSRP Failure
----------------------------

- Failing to successfully elect the active router that controls the virtual IP for the group.

- Failure of the standby router to successfully keep track of the active router.

- Failing to determine when control of the virtual IP for the group should be handed over to another router.

- Failure of end devices to successfully configure the virtual IP address as the default gateway.

    
Common HSRP Configuration Issues
--------------------------------

- The HSRP routers are not connected to the same network segment. Although this could be a physical layer issue, it could also be a VLAN subinterface configuration issue.

- The HSRP routers are not configured with IPv4 addresses from the same subnet. HSRP hello packets are local. They are not routed beyond the network segment. Therefore, a standby router would not know when the active router fails.

- The HSRP routers are not configured with the same virtual IPv4 address. The virtual IPv4 address is the default gateway for end devices.

- The HSRP routers are not configured with the same HSRP group number. This will cause each router to assume the active role.

- End devices are not configured with the correct default gateway address. Although not directly related to HSRP, configuring the DHCP server with one of the HSRP routerâ€™s real IP addresses would mean that end devices would only have connectivity to remote networks when that HSRP router is active.

- Because R1 is configured with the standby 1 preempt command, it initiates a coup and assumes the role of active route

EtherChannel must have the same speed, duplex setting, and VLAN information on all interfaces on the devices at both ends. Settings configured in the port channel interface configuration mode will also be applied to the individual interfaces in that EtherChannel. Settings configured on individual interfaces will not be applied to the EtherChannel or to the other interfaces in the EtherChannel.
