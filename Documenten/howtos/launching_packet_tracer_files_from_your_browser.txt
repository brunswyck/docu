check if your java is working correctly here by clicking the verify java version button
https://www.java.com/en/download/installed.jsp
make sure you allow the java plugin in my case IcedTea-Web
You should get a message similar to this

Verified Java Version
Completion checkmark
Congratulations!

You have the recommended Java installed (Version 8 Update 131).


I added to the /etc/profile the following lines

guru@vdab10:~$ sudo tail -n 5 /etc/profile
export PATH="$PATH:/opt/pt/bin"
PT7HOME="/opt/pt"
export PT7HOME


These variables didn't seem to load when logging off but that is because you are only logging out of your graphical session
Graphical logins do not read a shell's startup files (/etc/profile and ~/.profile and so on) by default,
but you as a user may choose to create a ~/.xsessionrc file which does this.

put this in your ~/.bashrc file
if [ -f ~/.xsessionrc ]; then
     . ~/.xsessionrc
fi

and this in the ~/.xsessionrc file
export PATH="$PATH:/opt/pt/bin"
PT7HOME="/opt/pt"
export PT7HOME

One way to fix this is by going to the preferences of your terminal
on your graphical terminal select edit>preferences> Command> "Run command as login shell"
You might be more successful by adding it to your ~/.bashrc file but I was just to stubborn to abandon my /etc/profile approach :-p

now when you launch your terminal again you should see these variables to make sure cisco finds what it needs to launch packet tracer 7
guru@vdab10:~$ env | grep pt
PT7HOME=/opt/pt
PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/games:/usr/games:/opt/pt/bin


go to https://assessment.netacad.net/check/check.html and download the Cisco Packet Tracer Assessment Environment Checker

run javaws + filenameyoudownloaded.jnlp
javaws PT-Assessment-Client.jnlp 

when successful you should see something like
vailable Ports -- 100%

Browser Name -- Firefox

Large File Download Capability -- Yes

JRE Version -- 1.8.0_131

Operating System Name -- Linux

Packet Tracer Deployment Directory -- /opt/pt

Packet Tracer IPC Ports Available -- Yes

Packet Tracer Version -- 7.0.0.0306

goodluck!
